Ominstru Manor is a "Location Module" for the Foundry VTT system. This location module
is designed to depict the Ominstru Manor in the Fethael Hundred of the Kingdom of Kaldor, on
the island of Hârn in the [HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy
setting; however, this manor could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic.  Detailed descriptions of the actors
has been provided in journal entries to facilitate conversion to other game systems.

Ominstru is a remote struggling manor, saddled with debt and disrepair, plagued by
bandits and secretly armed serfs, with a neglectful lord preoccupied with his hobbies.
