Originally from Melderyn, he is amused that the villagers call him a Southron because he is a foreigner from the south. Loran allows locals to think he is an eccentric nobleman pursuing his hobby of poking around old ruins. He won’t tell anyone what he is looking for but often pays villagers to tell him about things they’ve seen in the deep forest.</p>\n<p>He is, in fact, a Save K’norran scholar whose specialty is pre-Kaldoric religious history. He ha spent the last 12 years studying the history and relics of six minor Laranian saints from ancient Serelind. Loran has researched the subject extensively and thinks that he has located the home of one of the saints. Now, he looks for adventurous people to help investigate the ruins. Obsessed with history and iconography, Loran views the forest bandits as environmental hazards, much like wolves and other wildlife. He would only get concerned if he thought that the bandits might steal something from the ruins that would hinder his studies.</p>\n<p>Loran is a slight man of medium build. He can be fawning and unctuous when he wants something but arrogant and demanding when he feels that he is in a superior position. He is balding with long strands of graying yellow hair.

{"_id":"fIFwMwhaNZ65XdYb","name":"Settlement Overview","content":"<p><strong>Location:</strong> Fethael Hundred, Kaldor<br /><strong>Status:</strong> Manor<br /><strong>Government:</strong> Sir Falstran Haunty<br /><strong>Liege:</strong> Sir Eadwin Lournay (Drilen)<br /><strong>Population:</strong> Village 115; Manor 12</p>\n<p>Ominstru is unremarkable except that the village common anchors the end of the track from Emerule. This manor farms and raises cattle, as is typical of the western part of the Hundred. An old settlement, there are only two clans of peasants in this manor. A visitor might find the inhabitants of Ominstru quiet, even furtive.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>A young nobleman of clan Rynsel returning from the Migration Wars founded Ominstru. As the years passed and the clan’s bloodline thinned, the lordship passed to the Haunty clan by marriage. The manor’s out of the way location has spared it the ravages of war and strife. Enemy armies marched and pillaged their way along the Silver Way, but few forces could be bothered to send raiders into the dark forest to the end of the small track.</p>\n<h2>Government</h2>\n<p>Sir Falstran Haunty is Lord of Ominstru Manor and a vassal of clan Lournay. Sir Falstran is a rotund man who weighs over 300 lbs., as much as a cask of his favorite mead. Since the lord is obsessed with mead brewing, his wife, Lady Erlyna, and her mother, Lady Lorlyn, rule the manor except for the Hall Moot.</p>\n<h2>Economics</h2>\n<p>Like the other villages in the western part of Fethael Hundred, Ominstru raises cattle instead of sheep. The brushy woodland that surrounds the manor spoils any hope of producing wool, so the farmers concentrate on raising cattle for milk, butter, cheese, and beef. In good years, the village exports its smoked cheeses and meats to Getha in time for the Fair.</p>\n<p>Bees and furs from the slopes of Omin Mountain are the manor’s real source of income. Maunat (@Compendium[hm-loc-ominstru.journals.GE2h6fwMtBuKjAvw]{[5] Cottar (woodward) Maunat Faleren}) has carefully distributed his hives around the pastures north of the village. Sir Falstran prizes the clover honey that is gathered, claiming it makes superior mead. The wax from the hives is pressed into brick-sized cakes before being sold to the chandlers of Getha and Jenkald.</p>\n<p>Katrin the hideworker (@Compendium[hm-loc-ominstru.journals.Plz7aVhQjuJmIlUp]{[24] Hideworker Katrin Astal}) sends two large shipments of tanned hides to the ostlers and hideworkers in Getha for use in saddles and armor each year. Rich pelts of sable and bear are sent to the clothiers at midsummer.</p>\n<p>Sir Falstran’s love of mead consumes the manor’s privy purse and has sent him deep into debt. His collection of aged meads is worth tens of pounds to any discriminating collector in Tashal, Burzyn, or Cherafir. His emphasis on brewing has been at the expense of other activities, specifically the assart. The fields west of the village have become less and less productive as the forest reclaims those fields.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>The religious climate of Ominstru is similar to the rest of Kaldor, where worship of the “Dark Gods” is punishable by death and other religions are viewed with suspicion. The lord and his family attend Laranian services at the abbey in Lethyl or the Chapter House in Hakstyn, rather than endure the company of the Kobarneys of Hyzevel. The ride to the abbey is long, so Sir Falstran and his family generally stay the night before returning home. An Ebsathe visits from Hyzevel and holds Peonian rites in the common.</p>\n<h2>Current Events</h2>\n<p>The manor’s location at the end of the road has been both a blessing and a curse. Although their remote location has spared them from wars, predatory bandits are as common as wolves in winter. A group of bandits has been raiding the village’s stores from the forest to the west and south. They are usually content to steal food and drive off a few head of livestock but their most recent raids have targeted the village’s craftsmen. Within the past few months, the salter’s warehouse has been broken into during the night. Lady Erlyna is worried that the craftsmen may default on their taxes if they lose their goods.</p>\n<p>With Sir Falstran’s attention in the brew house, six members of the Arsarl clan have formed a vigilante militia to protect their fields and animals. The existence of such a group of armed and organized peasants is against the law but the reeve and the beadle see no alternatives.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"LreVFvP2R0HEhcPp":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":600000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.dNC1GppwcYwg414x"},"cf":{"id":null,"path":"Ominstru","color":"#000000"}}}

These scenes depict both internal and external areas; internal areas are generally set at a 5-foot grid spacing, while exterior areas use much larger scaling. The following subsections describe some common elements of these scenes.</p>\n<h3>Map Notes</h3>\n<p>The scenes make extensive use of Map Notes to provide detailed description of important areas in the scenes. To view these map notes, click on the \"bookmark icon\" in the canvas toolbar. Map notes are not visible to players, only to the GM.</p>\n<h3>Text and Markings</h3>\n<p>In various areas text and or markings have been provided in the scenes to assist the GM. Generally this information is set to only be visible to the GM.</p>\n<h3>Stairs</h3>\n<p>Some stairs may have an arrow indicating the direction the stairs descend. When present these arrows are visible to all players.</p>\n<h3>Lighting</h3>\n<p>To control ambient lighting, use the \"darkness\" setting for the scene.</p>\n<p>All scenes have been setup with Unrestricted Vision Range enabled, with a Vision Limitation Threshold set to 0.7. This allows all areas of the scene to be lit during the day, but vision is limited and lights are required at night.</p>\n<p>Internal lamps and candle lights have been placed in indoor areas. These lights have been set to enable when the \"darkness\" setting is ≥ 0.2, that is, just after things start becoming dim.</p>\n<p>Hârn has a cool climate, so all fireplaces and braziers are constantly lit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Recommended Modules</h2>\n<p>The following modules, although not required, are highly recommended to enhance this module:</p>\n<p><strong>Compendium Folders:</strong> Due to the large number of journal entries in this module, these journal entries have been organized into sub-folders using Compendium Folders. If Compendium Folders is not used, these will all show up as a single long list of Journal Entries in the compendium. As long as you follow the links starting with the _Overview journal entry, it should not be necessary to navigate the compendium, but if you want to navigate through the Journal Entries yourself, having Compendium Folders will greately simplify this task.</p>\n<p><strong>Backgroundless Pins:</strong> The map note icons all have a dark grey background; with this module, that background disappears.
