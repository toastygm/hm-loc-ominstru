While not weak, he is not a loud mouth bully like Sir Taerq. His key goal is to do good and this provides Sir Taerq with endless baiting fun. His family is from Bidow, where they are clerks and warders of the Shire Moot court. Beldis is in a difficult spot since Sir Flastran doesn’t care about chivalric pursuits and the rest of the Haunty family ignores him. He has become friends with Loran and is entertaining the idea of becoming a herald. His family wants him to become a knight in the Baron’s household, marry a landed girl, and raise the family back to being landowners. A tall order indeed.</p>",
